  Owning a motor vehicle can be quite unpredictable at times. That's where our
  services come in handy. We provide you with peace of mind to travel anywhere
  in the U.S. or Canada and know that you are covered for any roadside emergency
  that you may have. The biggest difference between MCA and many other leading
  roadside assistance companies is that we offer unlimited service requests and
  our benefits travel with the subscriber. Traveling with a friend and their car
  breaks down? As a valued Motor Club member, we've got you covered. Just got
  back on the road and it broke down again? No problem!
